/*
You are lost in Amman and need directions. You talk to a few strangers
and get these directions: go "NORTH", then "SOUTH", then "WEST", then "EAST", then "EAST".

Clearly "NORTH" and "SOUTH" are opposite, "WEST" and "EAST" too. 
Going to one direction and coming back the opposite direction is a needless effort.

Your task is to look at the directions and eliminate all unnecessary moves.
In this case, you will just go EAST.

Another example:

plan = ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"].

You can immediatly see that going "NORTH" and then "SOUTH" is not reasonable, 
better stay where you are. So the task is to find a simplified version of the plan. 

A better plan in this case is simply: 
plan = ["WEST"]

You have to write a function dirReduc which will take an array of strings 
and returns an array of strings with the needless directions removed.

More examples:

dirReduc(["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"]) => ["WEST"]
dirReduc(["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH"]) => [] //don't need to move at all
*/
// first we need to grap each element and copmare it to any other elements to cheeck if the oppisot is exists
function dirReduc(directions) {
  var opposite = {
    'NORTH': 'SOUTH', 'EAST': 'WEST', 'SOUTH': 'NORTH', 'WEST': 'EAST'};
  return directions.reduce(function(dirs, dir){
      if (dirs[dirs.length - 1] === opposite[dir])
        dirs.pop();
      else
        dirs.push(dir);
      return dirs;
    }, []);
}
